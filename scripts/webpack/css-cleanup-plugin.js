/**
 * @fileoverview Deletes all *.css.js files from the output directory after Webpack has finished compiling.
 *
 * Webpack 3.x emits ALL bundles as JavaScript files - even CSS. To get a plain .css file, we have to use
 * `extract-text-webpack-plugin` to yank the CSS out of the .css.js file and write it to a .css file.
 * This is done by `createCssExtractorPlugin()` in `plugin-factory.js`.
 *
 * However, we still end up with bunch of unneeded .css.js files in the output directory, so this plugin deletes them.
